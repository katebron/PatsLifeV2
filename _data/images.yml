  type_description: "Pat and family lived on Bluff Street, overlooking the Trinity River. World War Two began less than a year after Pat's birth. Sometime later, her Father Jeff Augustus Bird decided to move the family to a farm near Hope Arkansas. Jeff sold out in 1946 or 1947 and moved his family back to Fort Worth where he began a plumbing shop.
   Pat's first school must have been Charles Nash Elementary at 401 Samuels Ave, just a few blocks away. The school was built in 1927 and remains in use."
