# Childhood images

<p>Pat and I have a cherished collection of photographs; as the two of us near our end, it seems sensible to share some of these pictures with frineds and family.</p>
<p>In this way, those of you who know and befriended Patricia can restore and even extend your memories of her.</p>
<p>&As of this writing (2023-02-08) Patricia is ill, (probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontotemporal_dementia" target="_blank">FTD of the Progressive nonfluent aphasia variant</a>), bedridden and mute. But she still smiles, and chuckles at my silly japes.</p>
