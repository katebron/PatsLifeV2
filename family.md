# Family images

When two people unite, they necessarily bring along some dissparate inflluences, unique to each, from their childhood. Like the shadows on the wall of Plato's cave, the families of each mate give a shadow of the objective reality of familial influence.

Similarlly the family of Pat and Walt will have some influence of their upbringing.
